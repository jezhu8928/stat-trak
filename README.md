# StatTrak
The intended purpose of StatTrak is for anyone, of any experience level, to be able to track basketball statistics without hassle. For beginners and stats nerds alike, StatTrak allows you to track your favourite teams real time, and view game and season summaries for their play over time. As your tracked games accumulate, you will be able to identify trends and analyze the performance and growth of all of your teams.


### Background
Having played competitive basketball, we were both all too familiar with the struggle to track stats in youth games. Assistant coaches on our teams would often be tasked with the arduous task of tracking stats by hand, while parents sought a way to be able to track their children's development over time. Stats are hugely important in determining a team's gameplan; knowing the personnel of both your own team and the opposition, leveraging players' tendencies and weaknesses are crucial to emerging victorious in any game. Therefore, we decided to pursue the creation of a basketball stat tracking app for our final AP CS A project. 

After a meeting with stakeholders (parents and coaches on our respective youth teams), we identified common issues with competing apps, and the most desired functionality to incorporate into our app. Also, acknowledging our inexperience with Android development, we decided to limit the scope (i.e., we chose the most crucial functionality to implement, continuously re-scoping) of what we could accomplish within our project timeframe. 


### Tech Stack
* Android Studio
* Java (OOP)

### Features
The app includes functionality allowing statisticians to create and manage teams, view stats from an individual game or accumulated across a season, and track simple stats during a live game.

### Future Considerations & Next Steps 
While improvements on our initial iteration of this app have yet to be made, we're both interested in building upon this foundation in the future. Given our lack of experience with Android, much of the development we did with this app was not done using modern or more complex Android concepts (e.g. Compose, Room database). Beyond improving the efficiency/modernizing the architecture of the app, we'd also want to do the following:
* reduce crashing, more failsafing throughout
* create reusable layout components and improve overall UI
* use Room/SQLite database to persist data
  * potentially build a backend API
* use MVVM architecture, following Android best practices
* include more statistical analysis (e.g. shot chart, advanced analysis, plotting graphs, etc.)
